1. Browser shortcuts
- cmd + shift + c - inspect element
- option + cmd + j - console

2. Cmdline shortcuts
- cd - change directory
- ls -l - list all directories
- pwd - print working directory
- cd .. - go up a level in directory
- cmd + k - clears out terminal

3. Running JavaScript
- via devtools console
- via script tags in html file (before closing body tag for example, after the DOM elements have loaded)
- via script tag but from an external file (using src= in the script tag)
- via node.js in the terminal - runs via the node server ('node node-example.js' in the cmdline runs the js file in the node server)

4. Variables in JS
- let age = 300 - this can be changed if required in a block of code
- const age = 300 - this cannot be changed in a block of code
- var age = 300 - can be used when you don't want the above restrictions
- variables don't start with a capital letter, in convention best practice
- $ and _ can be used in variables - common in loadash and jQuery library
